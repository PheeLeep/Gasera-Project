Gasera [/out <file>] [options]
--------------------------------
/out <file>       - Writes the hash to the specified file path.                    
                    By default, the program writes two files. The MD5(UTF16LE()) hash
                    target, and the GUID that acts as a salt.

Options:

/h                - Shows help.
                    
--use-novel-hash  - Use the new hash format, instead of writing two files. (hash and GUID salt). 
                    (see the GitHub repo documentation for more details about the format.)

-i                - Don't exit if the hash is for blank password, and proceed to writing
                    the output anyway.

-fO               - Force to overwrite the file output.
-fA               - Force to append the file output with new value.

--------------------------------

For cracking the hash (GUID salt and Hash files.):

Hashcat:

Use '-a 1' for dictionary attack, or '-a 6' for mask attack. It's important to specify GUID file
first before the wordlist file or mask pattern, to prepend it with each password to guess.

The hash type is 70 '(md5(utf16le($pass)))'.

Example:
   hashcat -m 70 shadow-hash.txt -a 1 shadow-hash-guid.txt rockyou.txt
                       ^                       ^               ^
